  abstract = "In recent years we have seen significant advances in the
              technology used to both publish and consume structured data using
              the existing web infrastructure, commonly referred to as the
              Linked Data Web. However, in order to support the next generation
              of e-business applications on top of Linked Data suitable forms
              of access control need to be put in place. This paper provides an
              overview of the various access control models, standards and
              policy languages, and the different access control enforcement
              strategies for the Resource Description Framework (the data model
              underpinning the Linked Data Web). A set of access control
              requirements that can be used to categorize existing access
              control strategies is proposed and a number of challenges that
              still need to be overcome are identified.",
